# Note Taker App

A simple note-taker app that saves notes to a faux-database.

Starter code for the HTML, CSS, and front-end JavaScript was provided. The task at hand was to build the back-end, hook everything up, and set up get and post functionality.

How it was done:
- Made a server.js file and set up requirements ([Express](https://expressjs.com/), File System, access to the .json file, and [unique-slug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/unique-slug))
- Set up a PORT constant
- Set up HTML and API routes
- The first big challenge was setting up the middleware with app.use, particularly serving the static files. It took some trial and error to get the various file paths sorted with this.
- The next big challenge was getting the app.post function up and running and communicating with the db.json file. It was clear that in order to actually post a new note, it was necessary to read the db.json file and add to it. Actually doing that was much simpler than expected. This function went from a monstrosity of variables and fs methods to just 14ish lines of code. It was a case of throwing everything at it and then taking stuff away until it worked.
- Unique note IDs are generated by unique-slug, and in the future this will be useful for handling DELETE requests.  

Finished app is deployed on Heroku: https://taking-notes-42.herokuapp.com/
